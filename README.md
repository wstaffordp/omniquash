Omniquash is an endless, keyboard-only, minimalist, top-down, twin-stick shooter game for desktop browsers.

Addictive gameplay, cartoon violence, frantic animations, hypnotic repetition and portrayals of fictional danger may trigger sensitivity issues.

Anyone is free to play it. Download the [omniquash.html](https://github.com/wstaffordp/omniquash/blob/master/omniquash.html) file and open it in a modern browser. Zoom in a few times until the playing area occupies most of the screen.

Use the arrow keys to shoot and the `w` `a` `s` `d` keys to move.

The default weapon is a slow, weak blaster. Move within the pulsing circle to activate powerful weapons, then shoot enemies while avoiding them. The pulsing circle changes position every 5 seconds, alternating among 4 upgraded weapons.

Omniquash is built with CSS, HTML and `use strict` JavaScript without WebGL, game engine exports or shortcodes. The rendered vector graphics scale to any 16:9 resolution.

It was intended originally as a study of efficient algorithms for collision detection and visually-acceptable randomness from PRNGs that generate number sequences quickly with extremely-low statistical quality.

Although it's only a proof-of-concept, it's perfect to pick up and play occasionally without distractions from HUDs, advertisements, context switching, items, loading screens, menus, sounds or words.

I'll continue adding incremental enhancements until it seems worthy of porting to consoles and mobile devices as a premium game.
