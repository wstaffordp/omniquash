Unrolled is an endless, keyboard-only, minimalist twin-stick shooter game.

Anyone is free to play it by downloading the repository and opening the unrolled.html file in a modern web browser.

Addictive gameplay, cartoon violence, frantic animations, hypnotic repetition and portrayals of fictional danger may trigger sensitivity issues.

Use the arrow keys to shoot and the `w` `a` `s` `d` keys to move.

The default weapon is a slow, weak blaster. Move within the pulsing circle to activate powerful weapons, then shoot enemies while avoiding them.

The rendered vector graphics scale to any 16:9 resolution, so zoom in a few times until the playing area occupies most of the screen for an optimal gameplay experience.

The framerate is playable on a Google Pixelbook Go and should perform well on desktop devices with equivalent or superior specifications. It's built with CSS, HTML and `use strict` JavaScript without WebGL, game engine exports or shortcodes to achieve maximum performance in desktop browsers.

I'll continue adding incremental enhancements until it seems worthy of porting to consoles and mobile devices as a premium game.
